Code that would normally be installed via packages are temporarily stored here e.g. @sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-dev-tools, @sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-nuxtjs

It is conceivable that a pull request to the offical repository will be made at a later date.
Leaving it here for now for easy edit.

The official JSS repository lives in https://github.com/Sitecore/jss
